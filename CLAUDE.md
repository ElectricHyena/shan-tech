# Start local server on port 6000
python3 -m http.server 6000

# Or use any static file server
npx serve -p 6000
```

## Key Decisions

1. **Solo operator positioning** - Framed as advantage (direct contact, no jargon, personal service)
2. **Competitive pricing** - Below local competitor (£95/mo) but professional
3. **WhatsApp as primary CTA** - Low friction for local business owners
4. **Terms on each page** - Collapsible sections with tier-specific terms
